    <h1>Welcome back to the world of HTML.</h1>
    <p>Welcome back! Now, today, we are going to explore more features of the coding language, HTML. The first example we are going to do today is to insert a photograph into your HTML code. Depicted below, you can see an example of a photograph, and its caption:
      <figure>
        <img src="images/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="The duck, duck walked, walked up, up to, to the lemonade stand. Bom-ba-da!">
        <br />
        <figcation>The following photograph above this text depicts a photograph of my profile picture, that being a photograph of a scene from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtN1YnoL46Q"><i>The Duck Song</i></a>, a <b>Youtube</b> video by <i>forrestfire101</i>, the creator of <i>The Duck Song</i>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jjcAuEYW9M"><i>The Duck Song</i></a>, and, finally, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru4a-js4My4"><i>The Duck Song 3</i></a></figcation>
      </figure>
    <p>Anyway, with HTML, you can also add links and links directing you to a mailing address. Above this current text you are reading, I used three examples of links in the <code><figcation></code>, all of which link to videos uploaded onto <b>Youtube&reg;</b>. Overall, all the three music videos star a hysterical duck, who annoys a man at a the "lemonade stand," and a woman at the "corner store," simultaneously. There is also a book that has been published, based on <i>The Duck Song</i>, by its own artist, <b>Bryant Oden</b>!</p>
    <p>Anyway, without further a do, below this text, you can see a table of HTML code, and  its result. This table depicts what you need to type in order to create a specific item <i></p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th>HTML</th>
          <th>Result</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>How to create images</th>
          <th><code><figure>
                      <img src="images/Sea_otters_holding_hands (1).jpg" alt="Photograph of two sea otters floating in the water" />
                      <br />
                      <figcation>Sea otters hold hands when they sleep so they don't drift away from each other.</figcation>
                    </figure></code></th>
