    <h1>Welcome back to the world of HTML.</h1>
    <p>Welcome back! Now, today, we are going to explore more features of the coding language, HTML. The first example we are going to do today is to insert a photograph into your HTML code. Depicted below, you can see an example of a photograph, and its caption:
      <figure>
        <img src="The_duck_duck_walked_walked_up_up_to_to_the_lemonade_stand_bom_ba_da" alt="The uck, duck walked, walked up, up to, to the lemonade stand. Bom-ba-da!"
