    <h1>Welcome back to the world of HTML.</h1>
    <p>Welcome back! Now, today, we are going to explore more features of the coding language, HTML. The first example we are going to do today is to insert a photograph into your HTML code. Depicted below, you can see an example of a photograph, and its caption:
      <figure>
        <img src="images/The_duck_duck_walked_walked_up_up_to_to_the_lemonade_stand_bom_ba_da.jpg" alt="The duck, duck walked, walked up, up to, to the lemonade stand. Bom-ba-da!">
        <br />
        <figcation>The following photograph above this text depicts a photograph of my profile picture, that being a photograph of a scene from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtN1YnoL46Q"><i>The Duck Song</i></a>, a Youtube video by <i>forrestfire101</i>, the creator of of the following music videos starring a hysterical duck: <i>The Duck Song</i>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jjcAuEYW9M"><i>The Duck Song 2</i></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru4a-js4My"><i>The Duck Song 3</i></a>.</figcation>
      </figure>
    <p>Anyway, with HTML, you can also add links and links directing you to a mailing address. Above this current text you are reading, I used three examples of links in the <i><figcation></i>, all of which link to videos uploaded onto <b><i>Youtube&reg;</i></b> by <i>forrestfire101</i>. You have the ability to click those links in order to access their videos. As an experiment, you should really try out, and, I daresay, will be fun . . .
