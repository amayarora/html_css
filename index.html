    <h1>Welcome to the world of HTML.</h1>
    <p>HTML is a basic coding language, which can be used to create websites. With this coding language, you add or edit titles, paragraphs, photographs, links, URLs, etc. HTML is a great coding language for beginners.

    <p>There are even ways of making special characters using HTML, such as the Yen, Pound, Euro, etc. The table depicted below represents signs, and the code that corresponds to that particular sign:
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Special character</th>

        <tbody>
          <tr>

    <p>With HTML, you can also add and edit iFrames, lists, links, input boxes (e.g., for a password, browsing the world wide web, usernames, etc.), and much, much, much more. Overall, I highly recommend HTML as a beginner's coding language, and, hopefully, because of reading this repository on GitHub, you will start using HTML. Thank you for reading this repository.</p>
