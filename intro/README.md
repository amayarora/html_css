# html_css

The following text depicts a couple of files, which include both basic coding languages HTML and CSS, I created with GitHub! I hope you, since I am quite experienced with HTML, but not very fluent in the coding language of CSS, like my project. Overall, I hope you like the HTML and CSS files I created, and please, I highly recommend you preview most or all of the files.
